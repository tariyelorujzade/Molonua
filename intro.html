                <p>As a concerned American and Azerbaijan citizen, and as Azerbaijani-American this matter effects my
                    community and I personally. I demand an internal investigation on recent news reporting by your
                    journalists. Particularly, I request an investigation on the reporting by your employee Araksya
                    Karapetyan. This reporter has claimed without any evidence from either local or federal authorities,
                    that the vandalism act in the Armenian school in San Fransisco was done by Azerbaijani people. My
                    community is outraged at the slanderous accusation of this hate crime! It appears that this reporter is
                    unable to present unbiased news, and she evidently cannot keep her personal discrimination toward my
                    community out of the reporting of the news.
                </p>
                <p>On July 21st of this year, your station reported information that was not historically accurate. On that
                    day, the news stated that Joseph “Stalin gave the territory of Karabakh to Azerbaijan, although the
                    majority of people living there were Armenian.” Again, this is not accurate information and false ideas
                    were disseminated to your viewers. The true history of the region and detailed information is easily
                    available with a simple google search, although I encourage you to look into credible sources. The
                    United Nations convention and world countries have recognized Karabagh as Azerbaijan’s land and declared
                    Armenia as an aggressor and occupant. The world has been continuously demanding the withdrawal of
                    Armenian forces from the Azerbaijani territory, since the occupation over 20 years ago. The occupation
                    of Azerbaijani land has displaced the citizens, making Azerbaijan into a country with one of the largest
                    internally displaced persons population in the world. </p>
                <p>My community and I demand an investigation into biased reporting, slander and defamation by the
                    journalist at your station. We request your refutation of the false information reported in your news
                    and an official apology to the Azerbaijani community. I do have to state that if you choose not to
                    investigate, we will be left with no choice but to escalated this case to court.</p>
